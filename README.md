#MixLI_Lib
#Free, open-source, lightweight and highly configurable C++ TUI library for POSIX systems.

#Description
MixLI_Lib is a completly free and open-source project. It is a TUI(text user interface) library for C++ on POSIX systems. It has been created using C++ and only several standard libraries that should be pre-installed on every POSIX system. The main aim of this project is to create lightweight and customizable TUI library that can run on many operating systems.

#Features
-lightweight(Using special algorithms and some loss in looks it can save lots of RAM. Of course you don't have to use this option. Also I'm trying to use as little CPU power as possible.)
-portable(It can be easily ported to other operating systems, because of it standard dependencies. Also it can be easily wrapped for other programming languages than C++.)
-configurability(I'm leaving lots of decisions not only on looks of the TUI, but also on it's backend to user. This library is highly customizable, extendable and configurable.)
-freedom(Completly free and open-source.)
-code readability(I'm trying to code as simple, nice and functional as I can.)

#Info
This library is using POSIX threads for multithreading, standard I/O for input/output handling and it may use some other standard libraries in the future. It has been created using C++, compiled using gcc and debbuged using gdb. Most of the operation principles of this library, algorithms and data structures it is using will be explained in wiki when it's done.

#Usage And Installation
Usage of this library will be explained in wiki when it's done. If you want to see some examples look at testing file in "Example_Test" or watch video tutorials that may come out when it's done.(I will make them ;))
To install it just download files from "Library" folder and add them to your project.

#Future Of Project
When I am finished with version 0.01 I will try to port it to Windows and create Python wrapper for it.
Note that there is a highly probable problem that I may not finish this when I start to get bored with this project. :(

#Note
This project is currently under busy developement, so there may be some problems with bugs or mess in the code although I'm trying to code as proffesional as I currently can. Also, there may be hudge delays in work or pushing updates, because I'm busy with other things.

#Evereyone is welcome to contribute to this project, use it for their own projects or customize it to suit their needs! :D
#If you are going to use it in project of some kind commercial or not, please give me credit for this library. Thanks!
